# Active Directory Home Lab
When we are working as an IT Helpdesk or IT Service Desk, our team uses Active Directory whenever we receive calls that the user's account is locked, disabled or password reset request. If we are level 2 or with higher privileges, we can create a new user if there is a new hire in the organization.

There are times that we are wondering how this Active Directory works. In this GitHub repository, it demonstrates the setup process of a simple home lab that runs Active Directory on Oracle VirtualBox. Additionally, it includes instructions on how to add users using PowerShell.
